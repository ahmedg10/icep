## Concept
To utalize the back of the card, and write down list of nodes that have recieved the card, if the node sees they have held this card before it doesn't accept the card and the node passing card takes another path. 

### Issues To Awknowledge

1. We might have node die if it takes a path that is similar to a dead in. The node sees that nodes around it have all touched the card and run into the message getting killed
2. We might run into isseus with large network, as the back of card may get filled up.
